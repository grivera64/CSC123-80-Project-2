# CSC123-80 Project 2

My second project for the course contains the following programs:

1. SalesAnalysis
2. ISBNVerifier
3. CompareTimes
4. SieveOfPrimes

## How to compile
To compile these programs, you need to use JDK.

Using your terminal, type in these commands: (Example with SalesAnaylsis)

` //to compile the .java file into a .class file `

` javac SalesAnalysis.java `

` //to run the compiled .class file `

` java SalesAnalysis `
